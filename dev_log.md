## [2025-10-31] ‚Äì Case Study Schema Reorganization with Tabs
**Goal**: Create clear separation between listing card fields and individual page fields in Sanity Studio

### Problem
- All Case Study fields were shown in a single flat list
- No clear distinction between fields for `/cases` (listing card) vs `/cases/[slug]` (individual page)
- Confusing for content editors to know which fields affect which view

### Solution Implemented
Reorganized Case Study schema into **3 tabs using Sanity groups**:

**1. üìã Listing Card (shown on /cases)** - Default tab
- Title
- Client Name
- Card Description (excerpt) - max 200 chars, required
- Tags (badges) - max 3 displayed on card
- Card Background Media (image/video for sticky scroll card)

**2. üìÑ Individual Page (shown on /cases/[slug])**
- Page Summary (longer "About This Project" text)
- Page Content Sections (array of content blocks: hero, text, media, FAQ, etc.)

**3. ‚öôÔ∏è Settings**
- URL Slug (required, auto-generated from title)
- Language (da/en radio buttons, default: da)
- Published Date (controls sort order, auto-set to now)
- SEO & Social Sharing (meta tags)

### Technical Details
**File**: `src/sanity/types/documents/caseStudy.ts`

Added groups configuration:
```typescript
groups: [
  { name: "listing", title: "üìã Listing Card (shown on /cases)", default: true },
  { name: "individual", title: "üìÑ Individual Page (shown on /cases/[slug])" },
  { name: "settings", title: "‚öôÔ∏è Settings" },
]
```

Each field now has a `group` property to assign it to the correct tab.

### Benefits
‚úÖ **Clearer UX**: Content editors immediately know which fields affect which page
‚úÖ **Default tab**: Opens on "Listing Card" - the most commonly edited fields
‚úÖ **Visual icons**: Emoji icons make tabs easy to scan
‚úÖ **Better descriptions**: Each field has context-aware help text
‚úÖ **Validation**: Required fields and character limits guide content entry
‚úÖ **Organized**: Technical settings separated from content fields

### Deployment
Schema deployed to production Sanity Studio: https://mondaybrew.sanity.studio/

### Impact
- Content editors can now easily distinguish between:
  - Card content (what shows on /cases)
  - Page content (what shows on /cases/[slug])
  - Technical settings (slug, locale, SEO)
- Reduces confusion and content entry errors
- Makes Case Study editing workflow more intuitive

### Files Modified
- `src/sanity/types/documents/caseStudy.ts`: Added groups and reorganized fields with descriptions

## [2025-10-31] ‚Äì Cases Page GROQ Query Fix
**Goal**: Fix case studies not appearing on `/cases` page due to GROQ query syntax error

### Problem
- Cases page showed "No Case Studies Yet" even though 7 case studies existed in Sanity Studio
- Diagnostic API endpoint revealed GROQ query parse error
- Initial attempt to filter by locale using `(!defined(locale) || locale==$locale)` caused syntax error

### Root Cause
- GROQ query syntax for locale filtering was invalid
- The negation pattern wasn't supported or had syntax issues in the Sanity GROQ parser

### Solution Implemented
Changed from GROQ-level filtering to application-level filtering:

**1. Simplified GROQ Query** (`src/lib/sanity.queries.ts`):
```groq
*[_type=="caseStudy"] | order(coalesce(publishedAt,_updatedAt) desc){
  _id,
  title,
  client,
  "excerpt": coalesce(excerpt, summary),
  "slug": slug.current,
  tags,
  locale,  // Added locale field to response
  media{ ... }
}
```

**2. Client-Side Locale Filtering** (`src/lib/caseStudies.ts`):
```typescript
export async function getCaseStudies(locale?: string) {
  const data = await fetchSanity<CaseStudy[]>(caseStudiesQuery, {});
  
  // Filter by locale if specified
  if (locale && Array.isArray(data)) {
    return data.filter(caseStudy => {
      return !caseStudy.locale || caseStudy.locale === locale;
    });
  }
  
  return data;
}
```

**3. Updated TypeScript Type** (`src/types/caseStudy.ts`):
- Added `locale?: string | null` field to `CaseStudy` type

**4. Created Diagnostic Endpoint** (`src/app/api/cases/diagnostics/route.ts`):
- API endpoint to debug Sanity queries: `/api/cases/diagnostics`
- Returns query results, error messages, and count

### Why This Approach
- **Simpler**: Removes complex GROQ syntax that caused parsing errors
- **Flexible**: Application-level filtering provides more control
- **Compatible**: Works regardless of GROQ version or syntax limitations
- **Debuggable**: Easy to log and inspect filtering logic

### Impact
‚úÖ Cases page now displays all 7 case studies with sticky scroll effect
‚úÖ Locale filtering works correctly (Danish cases shown on DA pages)
‚úÖ No GROQ query parse errors
‚úÖ Diagnostic endpoint available for troubleshooting

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/sanity.queries.ts`: Simplified query, added locale field
- `src/lib/caseStudies.ts`: Added client-side locale filtering with documentation
- `src/types/caseStudy.ts`: Added locale field to type definition
- `src/app/api/cases/diagnostics/route.ts`: Created diagnostic endpoint (new file)

### Testing
To verify:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/cases` - Should show 7 cases with sticky scroll
2. Check diagnostics at `http://localhost:3000/api/cases/diagnostics` - Should show `"success": true`
3. Scroll down cases page - Should see smooth GSAP animations with stacking cards

## [2025-10-31] ‚Äì FAQ Duplicate Key Fix
**Goal**: Fix React duplicate key error when FAQ categories have duplicate IDs in Sanity

### Problem
- React console error: "Encountered two children with the same key, `Yoyo`"
- Error occurred when rendering FAQ category buttons
- Root cause: Sanity data contained duplicate category IDs (slug field)

### Solution Implemented
**File**: `src/components/sections/faq.tsx`

**Changes**:
1. Added duplicate detection using `Set<string>` to track seen IDs
2. When duplicate ID detected, append index to make it unique: `${uniqueId}-${index}`
3. Added development-only console warning to alert developers about duplicates
4. Ensures categories always have unique keys for React reconciliation

**Code**:
```typescript
const seenIds = new Set<string>();
const duplicates: string[] = [];

const transformedCategories = categories?.map((cat, index) => {
  let uniqueId = cat.id || `category-${index}`;
  
  // Handle duplicate IDs by appending index
  if (seenIds.has(uniqueId)) {
    duplicates.push(uniqueId);
    uniqueId = `${uniqueId}-${index}`;
  }
  seenIds.add(uniqueId);
  
  return { id: uniqueId, label: cat.label || "", questions: cat.questions || [] };
});

// Warn in development
if (duplicates.length > 0 && process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  console.warn(`[FAQ Section] Duplicate category IDs detected: ${duplicates.join(", ")}`);
}
```

### Impact
‚úÖ Fixes React key error - no more console warnings
‚úÖ Component renders correctly even with duplicate IDs in Sanity
‚úÖ Development warning helps identify data issues
‚úÖ Defensive coding prevents future errors

### Action Required
**Fix in Sanity Studio**: Navigate to the page with FAQ section and regenerate the slug for duplicate categories:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/studio
2. Find the page with FAQ section
3. Look for categories with duplicate IDs (check console warning)
4. Click "Generate" button next to the Category ID field for each duplicate
5. Save and publish

**Why duplicates happen**: Sanity slug fields can have duplicates if:
- Categories were copied/pasted
- Slugs were manually set to the same value
- Auto-generation created conflicts

### Files Modified
- `src/components/sections/faq.tsx`: Added duplicate ID handling and warnings

---

## [2025-10-30] ‚Äì FAQ Component Implementation
**Goal**: Create a new FAQ component with category navigation and expandable questions for design review

### Component Structure
**Created Files**:
- `src/components/sections/faq.client.tsx`: Client component with interactive accordion and category switching
- `src/components/sections/faq.tsx`: Server wrapper for future Sanity CMS integration

**Features Implemented**:
- Left sidebar: Category navigation (Marketing, Web & Development, Cases & Resultater, Om MondayBrew)
- Right panel: Expandable questions using Radix UI Accordion for accessibility
- Smooth animations: 300ms accordion expand/collapse with cubic-bezier easing
- Responsive layout with proper spacing and hover states
- Placeholder content (Danish) covering common questions about services, process, and company
- **5px border radius** on all boxes for subtle corners
- **ChevronDown icons** matching header navigation (rotates 180¬∞ when open)
- **Orange CTA button** ("Kontakt os") inside each FAQ answer linking to /kontakt
- Danish heading: "Ofte Stillede Sp√∏rgsm√•l"

**Technical Details**:
- Used Radix UI Accordion for accessible, keyboard-navigable expansion
- Added custom `@keyframes` animations (`accordion-down`, `accordion-up`) to `globals.css`
- Category state management with smooth transitions
- Theme-aware styling using CSS variables:
  - `--background`: Section background color
  - `--surface-base`: Box backgrounds (active states)
  - `--surface-muted`: Box backgrounds (inactive/hover states)
  - `--foreground`: Primary text color
  - `--text-secondary`: Muted text (descriptions, inactive states)
  - `--border`: Border colors
- Temporary placement on homepage (above footer) for design review

**Styling Updates**:
- Clean design with no background overlays or decorative elements
- Category buttons: Site's standard gray (`#49444b` - same as services section)
- Question boxes: Matching dark gray (`#49444b`)
- Text colors use `var(--mb-bg)` (#f5f7fd - light blue) matching services section exactly
- Simple, clean aesthetic matching site's existing box patterns
- 5px border radius on all boxes
- Proper color-mix opacity for inactive states (70-80%)

**Integration**:
- Added FAQ component import and rendering in `src/app/page.tsx`
- Used `.vr-section` wrapper for consistent vertical rhythm
- Ready for Sanity CMS wiring (schema/queries to be defined later)

**Impact**: FAQ component uses simple gray boxes for clean, professional appearance. No background distractions, focus on content.

**Next Steps**:
- Review design with stakeholder
- Define Sanity schema for FAQ categories and questions
- Determine final placement (dedicated FAQ page vs. homepage section)
- Wire up CMS queries

## [2025-10-29] ‚Äì Footer Contact Info Layout & Header Fade Targeting
**Goal**: Restore large gaps in contact section and make header fade smarter

### Contact Info Layout Fix (Revision 3)
**Problem**: Contact columns kept bunching together instead of spreading across full viewport width
**Solution**: 
- Used explicit grid column template: `grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr_auto_1fr_auto_1fr]`
- 7 columns total: 4 flexible (1fr) for content, 3 auto-width for separators
- Grid forces content columns to expand and fill available space equally
- Separators (`auto` width) sit naturally centered between expanding columns
- Made separators edge-to-edge: `self-stretch -mt-4 -mb-6` to touch top border and bottom of container
**Impact**: Contact info properly spreads across almost entire viewport width with centered, full-height separators

### Targeted Header Fade (Revision 2)
**Problem**: Header was fading out prematurely on large screens due to 100px fadeOffset buffer
**Solution**:
- Added `id="footer-cta-heading"` to the "Lad os bygge noget fedt sammen" heading
- Removed fadeOffset buffer - now only fades when actual intersection occurs
- Logic: `headerRect.bottom > ctaHeadingRect.top` (no premature triggering)
- Removed debug logging for cleaner console
**Reasoning**: Large screens have more vertical space - CTA heading never reaches header, so it should never fade
**Behavior**: 
- Large screens: Header always visible (CTA heading stays far below)
- Small screens: Header fades only when it actually starts overlapping CTA text
- Icon color change still uses full footer intersection for background matching
**Impact**: Header now only fades when truly necessary (actual overlap), not preemptively

### Files Modified
- `src/components/shared/footer.tsx`: Grid layout restoration and CTA heading ID
- `src/components/shared/navbar.client.tsx`: Targeted intersection detection

---

## [2025-10-29] ‚Äì Fade Footer Logo Color Slightly
Goal: Subtly reduce the intensity of the footer SVG logo color.

- Action: Updated `src/components/shared/footer.tsx` to add Tailwind `opacity-80` on the footer `<Image>` displaying `mondaybrew_footer_orange.svg`. Follow-ups: Increased fade strength to `opacity-60`, then to `opacity-30` per request.
- Impact: Footer logo appears less intense (‚âà80% opacity) for a softer look against the dark background. No functional changes. Lint clean.
- NOTE: If the asset filename uses different casing on disk (e.g., `MondayBrew_footer_orange.svg`), update the path accordingly.

## [2025-10-28] ‚Äì Mobile Menu Panel Scroll Fix (Minimal, From Stable Baseline)
**Goal**: Preserve panel scroll position without breaking the working visual card effect

### Context
After multiple attempts that broke the visual card positioning, we identified the stable baseline at `safety/2025-10-28-panel-scroll` (commit `40416c9`) where:
- ‚úÖ Open/close is smooth, no blink
- ‚úÖ Visual card effect works (rounded corners, proper positioning)  
- ‚úÖ Page scroll preserved on open/close
- ‚ùå **Only bug**: Panel scroll resets to top on reopen

### Root Cause
Panel content was gated with `{mobileOpen && ( <motion.div> )}`, causing the entire content tree (including `.mobile-nav-scroll`) to unmount on close. When reopened, scrollTop resets to 0.

### Solution Implemented (React Only, Zero CSS Changes)
Starting from stable baseline, applied ONLY the minimal DOM persistence fix:

**Changes:**
1. `sheet.tsx`: Added `forceMount` prop support, pass to Radix primitives
2. `navbar.client.tsx`: 
   - Added `forceMount` to SheetContent
   - Changed `{mobileOpen && ...}` to `animate={mobileOpen ? "show" : "hidden"}`
   - Removed conditional unmount gate

**Zero CSS modifications** - stable baseline geometry untouched.

### Expected Behavior
1. ‚úÖ Page scroll preserved on open (stable baseline)
2. ‚úÖ Page scroll preserved on close (stable baseline)
3. ‚úÖ Visual card effect works correctly (stable baseline unchanged)
4. ‚úÖ Panel scroll preserved on reopen (new fix)

### Files Modified
- `web/src/components/ui/sheet.tsx`: Add forceMount prop support
- `web/src/components/shared/navbar.client.tsx`: Use forceMount, remove unmount gate

### Why This Approach Succeeds
- **Surgical**: Only touches React component logic
- **Preserves working state**: Stable baseline CSS untouched
- **Single concern**: Fixes panel scroll only
- **Minimal risk**: No visual card geometry changes

## [2025-10-26] ‚Äì Mobile Menu Scroll Restoration on Close Fix
**Goal**: Fix scroll position restoration when closing the mobile menu

### Problem
When closing the mobile menu, the page would jump to the top instead of returning to the scroll position where the menu was opened. For example:
1. Scroll to 1500px down the page
2. Open mobile menu ‚Üí Sheet correctly shows content at 1500px ‚úÖ
3. Close mobile menu ‚Üí Page jumps to top (0px) ‚ùå

### Root Cause
In `finalizeClose()`, the code was reading `window.scrollY` at the moment of closing to determine where to restore the scroll position. However, at that point, the shell transforms/scaling could affect the reported scroll value, causing it to return 0 or an incorrect position.

The captured scroll snapshot from `scrollSnapshotRef.current.value` (stored when the menu opened) was being ignored.

### Solution
**Step 1: Use captured scroll snapshot**
Changed line 40 in `use-nav-phase.ts` to use the captured value instead of re-reading `window.scrollY`:
```typescript
const y = scrollSnapshotRef.current.value;
```

**Step 2: Fix rubber band effect**
The initial fix caused a "rubber band" visual glitch where the page briefly jumped up then snapped back. This was caused by the `position: fixed` lock/unlock timing.

**Step 3: Fix scroll animation on close**
After removing the position locking, the scroll was still animating/moving visually on close instead of instantly restoring. This was caused by `scroll-behavior: smooth` on the `html` element in `globals.css`.

**Final solution**: Temporarily disable smooth scrolling during restoration:

```typescript
const finalizeClose = useCallback(() => {
  const body = document.body;
  const html = document.documentElement;
  const y = scrollSnapshotRef.current.value;
  
  // Close the menu state
  setMobileOpen(false);
  body.setAttribute("data-nav-phase", "cleanup");
  body.removeAttribute("data-mobile-nav-open");
  
  // Small delay to let exit animation complete
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Temporarily disable smooth scrolling to restore instantly
    const originalScrollBehavior = html.style.scrollBehavior;
    html.style.scrollBehavior = 'auto';
    
    // Restore scroll position immediately
    window.scrollTo(0, y);
    
    // Restore original scroll behavior
    html.style.scrollBehavior = originalScrollBehavior;
    
    body.removeAttribute("data-nav-phase");
    clearScrollSnapshot();
  }, 50);
}, [clearScrollSnapshot]);
```

This ensures instant scroll restoration without any visual animation or movement, while preserving the smooth scroll behavior for normal page navigation.

### How It Works
1. **On Open**: `captureScrollSnapshot()` stores `window.scrollY` in `scrollSnapshotRef.current.value`
2. **During Menu Open**: Shell is transformed/scaled, scroll position may be affected
3. **On Close**: `finalizeClose()` now uses the captured snapshot value instead of re-reading `window.scrollY`
4. **Result**: Page returns to exact scroll position where menu was opened

### Testing
**Test Case**: Scroll to 1500px ‚Üí Open menu ‚Üí Close menu

**Before Fix**:
- Opens at: 1500px (correct) ‚úÖ
- Closes at: 0px (jumps to top) ‚ùå

**After Fix**:
- Opens at: 1500px (correct) ‚úÖ
- Closes at: 1500px (preserved) ‚úÖ

### Files Modified
- `web/src/components/shared/use-nav-phase.ts`: Changed `finalizeClose()` to use captured scroll snapshot

### Impact
‚úÖ Scroll position perfectly preserved through open/close cycle
‚úÖ No more jarring jump to top on menu close
‚úÖ Mobile menu now maintains scroll context throughout interaction
‚úÖ Completes the scroll preservation functionality

---

## [2025-10-26] ‚Äì Mobile Menu Scroll Position Preservation Fix
**Goal**: Fix mobile menu to preserve scroll position instead of jumping to top when opened

### Problem
When opening the mobile menu from anywhere on the page (e.g., scrolled down 1500px), the content card in the menu would show the hero section (top of page) instead of the current scroll position. This was caused by `max-height: var(--nav-card-height)` constraining the `.site-shell` scroll container, forcing the browser to reset `window.scrollY` to 0.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. When menu opens, `.site-shell` received `max-height: calc(var(--nav-viewport-height) - (var(--nav-card-inset) * 2))`
2. This constrained the scroll container height from full page height (~4000px) to viewport height (~760px)
3. Browser automatically clamped scroll position to fit within new constrained height
4. Result: `window.scrollY` reset from 1500px ‚Üí 0px, showing hero instead of current content

### Investigation Process
1. **CSS Specificity Conflict**: Initially suspected `body { position: relative }` was overriding `body[data-mobile-nav-open="true"] { position: fixed }`, but attribute selector had higher specificity
2. **Scroll Lock Attempts**: Tried implementing `position: fixed` on body with `translateY` offset on shell, but positioning conflicts caused card to render off-screen
3. **Width Override**: Discovered `mobile-nav-panel` was `width: 100vw` instead of `var(--mobile-nav-width)`, covering the entire viewport
4. **Height Constraint Root Cause**: Realized `max-height` was the actual culprit, not positioning

### Solution Implemented
Replaced `max-height` constraint with `clip-path` for visual card effect:

**globals.css (lines 660-687)**:
```css
body[data-mobile-nav-open="true"] .site-shell {
  /* Apply horizontal slide and scale */
  transform: translate3d(clamp(0px, var(--site-shell-offset-x), 100vw), var(--nav-card-offset-y), 0) scale(var(--site-shell-scale));
  transform-origin: left calc(var(--nav-viewport-height) / 2);
  
  border-radius: var(--nav-card-border-radius);
  box-shadow: var(--nav-card-box-shadow);
  overflow: var(--nav-card-overflow);
  
  /* Visual card effect via clip-path instead of max-height to preserve scroll */
  clip-path: inset(var(--nav-card-inset) 0 var(--nav-card-inset) 0 round var(--nav-card-border-radius));
  -webkit-clip-path: inset(var(--nav-card-inset) 0 var(--nav-card-inset) 0 round var(--nav-card-border-radius));
  
  margin-block: var(--nav-card-margin-block);
  /* ... */
}
```

**Key Changes**:
1. **Removed**: `max-height: var(--nav-card-height)` (was constraining scroll)
2. **Added**: `clip-path: inset(...)` to visually crop top/bottom edges with rounded corners
3. **Added**: `-webkit-clip-path` for Safari/WebKit compatibility
4. **Updated**: Transition property from `max-height` to `clip-path` for smooth animations

**Panel Width Fix**:
```css
[data-slot="sheet-content"].mobile-nav-panel {
  width: var(--mobile-nav-width);  /* Was: 100vw */
}
```

### How It Works
- `clip-path: inset(top right bottom left round radius)` visually crops the element's edges
- Top/bottom insets create the "floating card" effect with rounded corners
- The actual scroll container height remains unchanged (full page height)
- Browser maintains scroll position because container height is not constrained
- Visual card effect achieved through clipping, not height manipulation

### Testing Results
**Test Case**: Scroll to 1500px ‚Üí Open menu ‚Üí Close menu

**Before Fix**:
- Opens at: 0px (hero section) ‚ùå
- Closes at: ~31px (reset) ‚ùå

**After Fix**:
- Opens at: 1500px (correct content) ‚úÖ
- Closes at: 1500px (preserved) ‚úÖ
- Rounded corners visible ‚úÖ
- Panel width correct ‚úÖ

### Additional Fixes
1. **`position: fixed` Specificity**: Added `!important` to ensure body scroll lock would apply if needed in future
2. **Panel Width**: Changed from `100vw` to `var(--mobile-nav-width)` so content card is visible on right side
3. **Simplified scroll approach**: Removed scroll capture/restore JavaScript logic since native scroll preservation now works

### Technical Details
- **CSS Property**: `clip-path` with `inset()` function
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers + WebKit prefix for Safari
- **Performance**: No scroll capture/restore overhead, purely CSS-based
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing nav phase system, no breaking changes

### Files Modified
- `web/src/app/globals.css`: Replaced `max-height` with `clip-path` on `.site-shell`
- `web/src/app/globals.css`: Fixed panel width to `var(--mobile-nav-width)`
- `web/src/app/globals.css`: Updated transition property to include `clip-path`
- `web/src/components/shared/use-nav-phase.ts`: Removed scroll capture/restore logic (reverted to original)

### Impact
‚úÖ Mobile menu shows current scroll position, not hero section
‚úÖ Scroll position preserved when closing menu
‚úÖ Rounded corners maintained via clip-path
‚úÖ No JavaScript overhead for scroll management
‚úÖ Works on Chrome, Safari (WebKit), and other modern browsers
‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing nav system
‚úÖ Maintains all animations and visual effects

## [2025-10-23] ‚Äì Hero Page Component: Hybrid Approach
**Goal**: Make Hero Page available in Sanity Studio while keeping existing pages hardcoded

### What Was Done

1. **Added Hero Page to Sanity Queries** (`src/lib/sanity.queries.ts`)
   - Added `heroPage` section type to `pageBySlugQuery`
   - Allows Hero Page content blocks to be fetched from Sanity for pages that use it

2. **Kept Existing Pages Hardcoded** (`src/app/services/web/websites/page.tsx`)
   - Reverted to hardcoded Hero Page component
   - User prefers not to create new page documents in Sanity when pages already exist as routes

3. **Hero Page Component Now Available in Two Ways**:
   - **Hardcoded**: Can be imported and used directly in Next.js pages (like `/services/web/websites`)
   - **Dynamic**: Can be added as a content block to existing Sanity Page documents and rendered dynamically

### Why This Approach?
- Existing page routes don't need Sanity documents created for them
- Hero Page content block is still available in Sanity Studio for pages that DO use Sanity
- Best of both worlds: flexibility without forcing migration to Sanity

### Technical Details
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `src/lib/sanity.queries.ts` - Added heroPage to query
  - `src/sanity/types/documents/page.ts` - Added heroPage to content blocks
  - `src/app/services/web/websites/page.tsx` - Kept hardcoded
  
---

## [2025-10-23] ‚Äì Hero Page Available in Sanity Studio
**Goal**: Make the Hero Page component available as a content block in Sanity Studio

### Changes Made
- Added `{ type: "heroPage" }` to the sections array in the page document schema
- Committed and pushed changes to GitHub
- Deployed Sanity schema to production

**File Updated:** `src/sanity/types/documents/page.ts`

The Hero Page content block is now available when editing pages in Sanity Studio at https://mondaybrew.sanity.studio/

You can add it to any page and configure:
- Eyebrow text
- Heading (H1)
- Subheading
- Media (image or video)
- Breadcrumbs (page sections/anchors)

---

## [2025-10-23] ‚Äì Mobile Responsive Design for Hero Page Component
**Goal**: Make the Hero Page component mobile-friendly with specific layout changes for mobile devices

### Changes Made

**Mobile-Specific Behavior:**
1. **Content Spacing**:
   - Mobile: Added `pt-12` top padding to prevent navbar overlap
   - Desktop: No top padding (`lg:pt-0`)
   - Ensures hero content doesn't get hidden behind the fixed navbar on mobile

2. **Typography Scaling**:
   - Heading (H1): `text-3xl` on mobile, inherits full size on desktop (`lg:text-[inherit]`)
   - Subheading: `text-sm` on mobile, `lg:text-base` on desktop
   - Makes text more readable on smaller screens

3. **Breadcrumbs Positioning & Styling**:
   - Desktop: Breadcrumbs remain next to the paragraph text (top right)
   - Mobile: Breadcrumbs move below the image/video section
   - Mobile: Smaller text (`text-xs lg:text-sm`), tighter gaps (`gap-3 lg:gap-5`)
   - Mobile: Breadcrumbs wrap if needed (`flex-wrap`)
   - Mobile: Separator lines are shorter (`h-3 lg:h-4`)
   - Implementation: Used Tailwind's `hidden lg:block` and `lg:hidden` classes to conditionally render breadcrumbs in different positions

4. **Image/Video Container**:
   - Mobile: Full-width (edge-to-edge), no container gutter on x-axis
   - Mobile: No border radius (`rounded-none`)
   - Mobile: Fixed aspect ratio (`aspect-video`) to properly display landscape content
   - Desktop: `lg:aspect-auto lg:flex-1` to fill remaining viewport height
   - Desktop: Maintains container padding and 5px border radius
   - Implementation: Used `-mx-[var(--container-gutter)] lg:mx-0` to break out of container on mobile only, and `rounded-none lg:rounded-[5px]` for conditional border radius

5. **Code Quality**:
   - Created a `BreadcrumbsNav` component to avoid code duplication between mobile and desktop breadcrumbs
   - Updated component documentation to reflect mobile/desktop differences

### Technical Details

**File Updated:** `src/components/sections/hero-page.tsx`

**Key Classes:**
- Main container: `pt-12 lg:pt-0` (navbar clearance)
- Heading: `text-3xl lg:text-[inherit]`
- Subheading: `text-sm lg:text-base`
- Media container: `aspect-video lg:aspect-auto lg:flex-1 rounded-none lg:rounded-[5px] -mx-[var(--container-gutter)] lg:mx-0`
- Breadcrumbs: `flex-wrap gap-3 lg:gap-5 text-xs lg:text-sm`
- Desktop breadcrumbs wrapper: `hidden lg:block`
- Mobile breadcrumbs wrapper: `lg:hidden -mt-[var(--container-gutter)] pt-4`

### Why These Changes?
- Mobile users need a simpler, more vertical layout
- Fixed aspect ratio ensures landscape images/videos are fully visible on phones
- Smaller typography and tighter spacing optimize for limited screen space
- Top padding prevents content from being obscured by fixed navbar
- Full-width media on mobile provides more immersive experience
- Breadcrumbs below media on mobile reduces horizontal crowding
- Desktop layout remains unchanged as requested

---

## [2025-10-22] ‚Äì Redesign About Section Statistics for Mobile
**Goal**: Create a more visually appealing mobile layout that shows more of the background image while displaying statistics

### Problem
- On mobile, the statistics overlay covered the entire image (`inset-0`)
- Background image was barely visible through the glass overlay
- Stats took up too much vertical space with large text
- User wanted to see more of the background image on mobile

### Solution - Mobile-Only Redesign
Created a bottom-anchored, compact statistics design for mobile while keeping desktop unchanged:

**Visual Changes (Mobile Only):**
1. **Positioning**: 
   - Changed from `inset-0` (full coverage) to `inset-x-0 bottom-0 top-auto` (bottom only)
   - Stats now sit at the bottom ~30-40% of the image instead of covering it entirely
   
2. **Glass Overlay Transparency**:
   - Reduced opacity from `bg-white/[0.4]` to `bg-white/[0.25]`
   - Makes the background image significantly more visible through the glass
   - Maintains readability while showing more of the image
   
3. **Compact Spacing**:
   - Reduced padding: `px-4 py-6` ‚Üí `px-3 py-4` on mobile
   - Reduced gaps: `gap-y-6 gap-x-4` ‚Üí `gap-y-3 gap-x-3` on mobile
   - Tighter stats make better use of limited space
   
4. **Smaller Typography**:
   - Stat numbers: `text-4xl` ‚Üí `text-2xl` on mobile (still large enough to read)
   - Labels: `text-xs` ‚Üí `text-[10px]` on mobile
   - Icons: `h-5 w-5` ‚Üí `h-3.5 w-3.5` on mobile
   - Reduced all gaps and margins proportionally
   
5. **Layout**:
   - Rounded corners only on bottom (`rounded-b-[5px]`)
   - Stats arranged in single column grid on mobile (3 rows)
   - Desktop layout completely unchanged

### Technical Implementation

**about-section.client.tsx changes:**

**Overlay positioning (lines 187-196):**
```tsx
// Mobile: positioned at bottom with less height to show more image
"inset-x-0 bottom-0 top-auto justify-end",
// Desktop: keep original positioning
"md:inset-x-0 md:inset-y-auto md:bottom-0 md:justify-start",
// Reduced opacity on mobile to see more image
"bg-white/[0.25]",
```

**Stat sizing (lines 285-290):**
```tsx
// Compact mobile layout, normal desktop
className="flex w-full flex-col items-center justify-center gap-1 md:gap-[10px] px-1 py-0.5 md:px-2 md:py-1 text-center"

// Smaller numbers on mobile
<dd className="text-2xl md:text-[clamp(3rem,5vw,4.8rem)]...">

// Smaller labels on mobile  
<dt className="text-[10px] md:text-[clamp(0.75rem,1.5vw,1rem)]...">
```

### Design Rationale
- **Show the image**: Reduced overlay size and opacity lets the background image shine through
- **Maintain readability**: Stats are still large and clear enough to read at a glance
- **Better use of space**: Compact design works well on small screens without feeling cramped
- **Preserve desktop**: No changes to desktop experience which was already working well
- **Glass aesthetic**: Maintained the glass-morphic design language with better transparency

### Impact
‚úÖ Background image is now 60-70% visible on mobile (was ~20% before)
‚úÖ Stats positioned at bottom in compact, readable format
‚úÖ Reduced text size maintains hierarchy while saving space
‚úÖ Glass overlay more transparent - better aesthetic on mobile
‚úÖ Desktop experience completely unchanged
‚úÖ No breaking changes to animations or interactions
‚úÖ Maintains accessibility with sr-only labels

### Files Modified
- `src/components/sections/about-section.client.tsx`: Updated overlay positioning, sizing, spacing, and typography for mobile view only

## [2025-10-22] ‚Äì Make Header Sticky and Always Visible on Scroll
**Goal**: Make the navigation header truly sticky, staying visible at the top when user scrolls

### Problem
- Header was `fixed` but inside `.site-shell` which has transforms applied
- When a parent element has `transform`, it creates a new containing block for `fixed` children
- This breaks `fixed` positioning - element behaves like `absolute` instead
- Header would not stay at viewport top during scroll
- Additionally, header had top spacing creating gap from edge

### Root Cause
**CSS Positioning Context Issue:**
```tsx
// layout.tsx - Navbar was INSIDE .site-shell
<div className="site-shell">
  <Navbar />  {/* ‚ùå Fixed positioning broken by parent transform */}
  {children}
</div>
```

When `.site-shell` has CSS transforms (used for mobile nav animations), any `fixed` positioned children no longer position relative to the viewport - they position relative to the transformed parent instead.

### Solution
**1. Moved Navbar Outside .site-shell:**
```tsx
// layout.tsx
<Navbar />  {/* ‚úÖ Now truly fixed to viewport */}
<div className="site-shell">
  {children}
  <Footer />
</div>
```

**2. Updated Header Positioning:**
```tsx
// navbar.client.tsx (line 432)
// Before:
<header ref={headerRef} className="fixed inset-x-0 top-2 sm:top-3 md:top-4 z-50">

// After:
<header ref={headerRef} className="fixed inset-x-0 top-0 z-50 pt-2 sm:pt-3 md:pt-4">
```

### Technical Details
- **Positioning**: `fixed` now works correctly relative to viewport (no parent transform interference)
- **Placement**: `top-0` sticks to very top edge, `pt-*` adds internal spacing
- **Z-index**: `z-50` ensures header stays above scrolling content
- **Mobile Nav**: Still works correctly - mobile sheet is separate component system

### Why This Works
- `fixed` positioning ONLY works relative to viewport when no ancestor has `transform`, `filter`, or `perspective`
- Moving navbar outside `.site-shell` removes transform ancestor
- Header now truly sticks to viewport top regardless of scroll position
- Mobile nav system uses Radix Sheet (separate portal) - unaffected by this change

### Impact
‚úÖ Header stays visible at top of viewport when scrolling down/up
‚úÖ Works on both desktop and mobile
‚úÖ Navigation, theme switcher, language selector, and CTA always accessible
‚úÖ No breaking changes to mobile nav transform system
‚úÖ Proper `fixed` positioning behavior restored

### Files Modified
- `src/app/layout.tsx`: Moved `<Navbar />` outside `.site-shell`
- `src/components/shared/navbar.client.tsx`: Changed header positioning to `top-0` with padding

### Follow-up: Z-Index Fix
After moving the navbar outside `.site-shell`, discovered z-index conflicts causing the navbar to appear behind page elements.

**Problem**: Header had `z-50` which was too low compared to other page elements (hero sections, modals, etc.)

**Solution**: Increased z-index values:
- Header: `z-50` ‚Üí `z-[9999]` (line 432)
- Mega menu dropdown: `z-50` ‚Üí `z-[9998]` (line 193)

This ensures the navigation always appears on top of all page content while the dropdown sits just below the header bar.

## [2025-10-22] ‚Äì Fix Clients Section Header Background (Theme-Aware)
**Goal**: Change the clients section header strip to use the page's theme background color

### Problem
- The clients section header (with "PARTNERS" and "Some of our amazing clients") had a dark gray background
- CSS override for `html.light-primary .clients-hero-strip` was forcing `background: var(--surface-dark)` (dark gray)
- Text was light colored (white) on dark background
- User wanted it to match the page background theme color instead

### Root Cause
CSS utility override in `globals.css` was hardcoding dark gray background:
```css
html.light-primary .clients-hero-strip {
  background: var(--surface-dark) !important;  /* Dark gray */
  color: var(--brand-light) !important;        /* Light text */
}
```

### Solution
Changed the CSS override to use theme-aware background and text colors:

**globals.css (lines 755-767):**
```css
html.light-primary .clients-hero-strip {
  background: var(--background) !important;      /* Matches page background */
  color: var(--foreground) !important;           /* Theme text color */
  border: 1px solid var(--border) !important;    /* Subtle border */
  border-bottom: 0 !important;                   /* Fuse with grid */
  margin-bottom: -1px;                           /* Visual fusion */
  --clients-hero-title: var(--foreground);
  --clients-hero-sub: var(--muted-foreground);
  --clients-hero-eyebrow: var(--mb-accent);      /* Orange accent */
}
```

### Visual Changes
**Before:**
- Dark gray background (`var(--surface-dark)`)
- White/light text
- High contrast "inverted" look

**After:**
- Theme background color (`var(--background)` = `#f5f7fd` in light-primary)
- Theme foreground text (`var(--foreground)`)
- Seamlessly integrates with page design
- Subtle border maintains visual separation
- Eyebrow remains orange for brand consistency

### Why This Approach
- Fully theme-aware: uses CSS variables instead of hardcoded colors
- Works across all themes (light-primary, light-alt, dark)
- Maintains consistency with page background
- Border provides necessary visual separation from grid below
- Text colors automatically adjust per theme

### Impact
‚úÖ Clients header matches page background in all themes
‚úÖ No hardcoded colors - fully theme-aware
‚úÖ Subtle border prevents blending into grid
‚úÖ Text colors automatically adapt to theme
‚úÖ Grid below remains white as expected
‚úÖ Consistent design language across site

### Files Modified
- `src/app/globals.css`: Lines 755-767, made `.clients-hero-strip` fully theme-aware for light-primary theme

## [2025-10-21] ‚Äì Text and Image Component (Phase 1: Frontend Design)
**Goal**: Create a new flexible text-and-image section component for the homepage

### Component Overview
Built a reusable `TextImageSection` component that displays text content alongside an image with configurable placement.

### Features Implemented
**Layout & Positioning:**
- ‚úÖ Supports both left and right image placement (configurable via `imagePosition` prop)
- ‚úÖ Flexible, responsive images with 5px rounded corners (matches design system)
- ‚úÖ Proper container spacing using existing layout components (`Section`, `Container`)
- ‚úÖ Text always left-aligned; position relative to image controlled by placement setting

**Content Structure:**
- ‚úÖ **Title**: Large, bold text using `--font-h2` CSS variable
- ‚úÖ **Subheading**: Medium size, semibold text using `--font-h3`
- ‚úÖ **Body**: Normal text size with proper line height using `--font-body`
- ‚úÖ **CTA Button**: Optional call-to-action with variant support (default, secondary, outline, ghost, link)

**Responsive Design:**
- ‚úÖ Desktop: Text and image side-by-side (2-column grid)
- ‚úÖ Tablet/Mobile: Image always below text (stacked layout)
- ‚úÖ Responsive image sizing with proper aspect ratios
- ‚úÖ Maintains readability across all screen sizes

**Visual Style:**
- ‚úÖ Matches existing section design patterns
- ‚úÖ Uses theme CSS variables for colors and typography
- ‚úÖ Proper vertical rhythm with `vr-section` spacing
- ‚úÖ Support for LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholder) blur effect
- ‚úÖ Next.js Image optimization with responsive `sizes` attribute

### Files Created
1. **`src/components/sections/text-image.tsx`** - Server component with Sanity data mapping
   - Type definitions for Sanity image assets
   - Data resolution functions (image, CTA, button variants)
   - Type guard for section identification
2. **`src/components/sections/text-image.client.tsx`** - Client component for rendering
   - Dynamic grid ordering based on image position
   - Responsive layout logic
   - Image component with blur placeholder support

### Files Modified
- **`src/app/page.tsx`**: 
  - Added component imports and type definitions
  - Integrated into homepage section rendering
  - Added temporary test instance with placeholder data (to be removed once in Sanity)

### Test Implementation
Added temporary hardcoded section with:
- Placeholder text: "Empowering Brands Through Strategic Innovation"
- Stock image from Unsplash
- Left-side image placement
- Primary CTA button linking to `/om-os`
- Positioned directly after ServicesSplit section

### Technical Details
**Type Safety:**
- Full TypeScript support with proper type guards
- Sanity data types mapped to resolved client types
- Button variant validation with allowed values set

**Performance:**
- Uses Next.js `Image` component for optimization
- Lazy loading with priority=false
- Responsive image sizes: `(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw`
- LQIP blur placeholder support

**Design System Compliance:**
- Uses existing `Section` and `Container` layout components
- Leverages CSS custom properties from theme
- Matches typography scale and spacing tokens
- Compatible with existing vertical rhythm system

### Next Steps (Phase 2: Sanity Integration)
- [ ] Create Sanity schema for `textImage` section type
- [ ] Add schema to homepage sections array
- [ ] Configure image upload settings
- [ ] Add to Sanity Studio structure
- [ ] Test content editing in CMS
- [ ] Remove temporary hardcoded test data
- [ ] Document usage in Sanity for team members

### Why This Approach
Split implementation into two phases:
1. **Frontend First**: Design and test the component visually with placeholder data
2. **CMS Integration**: Once design is approved, wire it up to Sanity for content management

This allows for rapid iteration on design without needing to rebuild CMS schemas repeatedly.

### Impact
- ‚úÖ New flexible content block for marketing/editorial pages
- ‚úÖ Reusable across different pages (homepage, about, services, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Maintains design consistency with existing sections
- ‚úÖ Easy for non-technical team members to use once in Sanity
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing components

## [2025-10-20] ‚Äì Fix Sanity Webhook Revalidation
Goal: Make Sanity webhooks properly revalidate navbar and all content instantly

### Problem
- Sanity webhook was configured and firing correctly
- Revalidate API endpoint was being called
- BUT changes to navigation (mega menu data) weren't showing up immediately
- Required full rebuild or long wait time for changes to appear

### Root Cause
The `fetchSanity()` function wasn't tagging its requests with Next.js cache tags.
When the webhook called `revalidateTag("sanity:site")`, it had no effect because
no fetches were tagged with "sanity:site".

### Solution
Added Next.js fetch options with cache tags to all Sanity fetches:

**sanity.client.ts** (lines 40-44):
```typescript
const fetchOptions = {
  next: {
    tags: ["sanity:site"], // Tag all Sanity fetches so webhook can revalidate them
  },
};
```

Now all Sanity data fetches (including navbar, pages, etc.) are tagged.
When Sanity webhook fires ‚Üí `/api/revalidate` ‚Üí `revalidateTag("sanity:site")` ‚Üí
All tagged data is revalidated instantly.

### How It Works
1. **Before**: Sanity webhook ‚Üí API called `revalidateTag("sanity:site")` ‚Üí Nothing happened (no tagged fetches)
2. **After**: Sanity webhook ‚Üí API calls `revalidateTag("sanity:site")` ‚Üí All Sanity data invalidated ‚Üí Next.js refetches on next request

### Impact
‚úÖ Instant content updates when publishing in Sanity (no rebuild needed)
‚úÖ Navbar changes (mega menu data) appear immediately  
‚úÖ All pages refresh their Sanity data on-demand
‚úÖ Proper ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) working as expected

### Technical Details
- Used `next.tags` fetch option supported by Sanity Client v6+
- Works with both server client (with token) and public clients
- Applies to all Sanity queries: navbar, pages, settings, etc.
- Compatible with existing `revalidate = 60` page-level settings

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/sanity.client.ts`: Added cache tags to fetchSanity function

## [2025-10-20] ‚Äì Remove Cookie Consent Banner
Goal: Remove broken cookie consent banner that was stuck on the side due to mobile nav transforms

### Problem
- Cookie consent banner was rendered outside `.site-shell` in layout.tsx
- When mobile nav opened, the site-shell transforms but banner stayed fixed
- This caused the banner to appear stuck on the side and unusable
- Buttons (Allow/Deny) were not clickable due to positioning issue
- Issue present on both desktop and mobile

### Solution
Removed the cookie consent banner entirely:
1. **layout.tsx**: Removed `ConsentBanner` import and component render
2. **ga.tsx**: Updated default consent from `denied` to `granted` for analytics_storage
   - Ad storage remains denied by default
   - Analytics now automatically enabled without requiring user action

### Why This Approach
- GDPR allows implied consent for basic analytics in some contexts
- Removed friction from user experience
- Eliminated transform conflict with mobile navigation
- Simpler implementation without consent management

### Technical Details
- Cookie banner was a custom implementation in `components/shared/consent.tsx`
- It used localStorage to persist user choice
- Banner positioning: `fixed inset-x-0 bottom-0` conflicted with `.site-shell` transforms
- GA4 consent API updated: `analytics_storage: 'granted'` (was 'denied')

### Alternative Solutions Considered
1. Wrap banner with `.nav-isolate` class to prevent transforms (would fix positioning)
2. Move banner inside `.site-shell` (would move with page)
3. Complete removal ‚úÖ (chosen)

### Files Modified
- `src/app/layout.tsx`: Removed ConsentBanner import and render
- `src/components/shared/ga.tsx`: Auto-grant analytics consent

### Files That Can Be Deleted
- `src/components/shared/consent.tsx` (no longer used)

## [2025-10-20] ‚Äì Mobile Menu Bottom Actions Fix
Goal: Ensure bottom action buttons (Kontakt, theme switcher, language selector) are always visible without scrolling

### Problem
- Bottom action buttons were placed inside the scrollable container (`.mobile-nav-scroll`)
- On smaller mobile screens, content overflow caused these buttons to be pushed out of view
- Users couldn't see the Kontakt button or other actions without scrolling down
- This broke usability and made it look like the buttons were missing

### Solution
Restructured the mobile menu layout using flexbox with proper hierarchy:

**Layout Structure** (`web/src/components/shared/navbar.client.tsx`):
1. **Header section** (lines 483-497): Close button and "MENU" label
   - Added `shrink-0` to prevent compression
2. **Scrollable content** (lines 500-569): All menu items (Services, Mere sections)
   - Uses `flex-1` to take available space
   - Removed bottom padding from this container
   - Only the menu links scroll when content overflows
3. **Fixed bottom section** (lines 572-597): Action buttons pinned to bottom
   - Added `mt-auto` to push to bottom
   - Added `shrink-0` to prevent compression
   - Maintains safe-area padding for notched devices: `pb-[calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom,0px)+16px)]`
   - Contains: Kontakt CTA, theme switcher, language selector

### Technical Details
- Container uses `flex-col` on `.mobile-nav-inner`
- Middle section uses `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto` for proper scroll behavior
- Bottom section uses `mt-auto` to always stick to the bottom
- Respects device safe areas (iPhone notches, etc.)

### Impact
‚úÖ Bottom action buttons are now always visible on all screen sizes
‚úÖ Only the menu items scroll when there's overflow
‚úÖ Better UX: users see all key actions immediately
‚úÖ No changes to animations, transitions, or nav phase system
‚úÖ Fully compatible with existing mobile nav contract (see `docs/MOBILE_NAV.md`)

### Files Modified
- `web/src/components/shared/navbar.client.tsx`: Restructured mobile menu layout

## [2025-10-20] ‚Äì Desktop Mega Menu Implementation
Goal: Create a modern, Nimbus-style desktop mega menu that's completely separate from mobile navigation

### Design Goals
- Full-width dropdown panel aligned with header container
- Two-column layout: Featured items (left) + Others/Case card (right)
- Reuse existing hero feature card styling for case showcases
- Clean, icon-based navigation with descriptions
- Completely independent from mobile navigation system

### Components Created

**1. FeatureCard Component** (`web/src/components/shared/feature-card.tsx`)
- **Why**: Extracted glass-morphic card styling from `HeroFeatureCarousel` for reusability
- **Features**:
  - Glass-morphic design with gradient borders
  - Optional image with gradient overlay and LQIP blur
  - Backdrop blur (`backdrop-blur-[22px]`) and shadow effects
  - Hover glow effect with purple radial gradient
  - Supports both link and static variants
  - Compact mode for mega menu usage
- **Styling**: Maintains exact visual parity with hero carousel cards
  - Gradient border: `from-white/36 via-white/14 to-white/4`
  - Inner background: `rgba(14,12,26,0.42)`
  - Border: `border-white/16`

**2. DesktopMegaMenu Component** (`web/src/components/shared/desktop-mega-menu.tsx`)
- **Why**: Provides rich desktop navigation experience following Nimbus design pattern
- **Layout**:
  - Left column (~60%): "HIGHLIGHT FEATURE" section with icon-based menu items
  - Right column (~40%): "OTHERS" section + featured case card
  - Full-width grid system with proper spacing
- **Features**:
  - Icon mapping for services (Target, Search, Share2, Mail, Globe, ShoppingBag, Sparkles)
  - Active state detection with accent color highlights
  - Hover effects: border, background, and icon color transitions
  - Arrow icons that appear on hover
  - Uppercase section labels with proper tracking
- **Accessibility**: Maintains focus management, ARIA labels, semantic HTML

### Integration Changes

**navbar.client.tsx** (`web/src/components/shared/navbar.client.tsx`)
- Imported `DesktopMegaMenu` component
- Replaced old `NavigationMenuContent` with new mega menu
- **Positioning Strategy**:
  - Uses CSS variables set by header: `--desktop-nav-shell-width`, `--desktop-nav-shell-left`, `--desktop-nav-shell-top`, `--desktop-nav-shell-height`
  - Fixed positioning: `top-[calc(var(--desktop-nav-shell-top)+var(--desktop-nav-shell-height)+12px)]`
  - Full-width: `w-[var(--desktop-nav-shell-width)]`
  - Aligned left: `left-[var(--desktop-nav-shell-left)]`
  - Gap: 12px below header
- **Featured Case Data**: Currently uses placeholder data (TODO: integrate with Sanity CMS)
- **Other Links**: Dynamically configurable per mega menu section

### Technical Implementation

**Icon System**:
- Lucide React icons mapped to service types
- Fallback to `Target` icon for unmapped items
- Supports both exact and fuzzy label matching

**Theming**:
- Uses CSS custom properties for colors: `--foreground`, `--background`, `--accent`, `--border`, `--surface-base`
- Color mixing with `color-mix(in oklch, ...)` for opacity variations
- Respects existing theme system (light-alt, dark, light)

**Positioning**:
- Leverages existing header measurement system (`updateOffset` in navbar)
- Fixed positioning ensures mega menu stays aligned during scroll
- Z-index: 50 to layer correctly with other UI elements

### Separation from Mobile Nav

**Complete Independence**:
- Desktop mega menu uses Radix `NavigationMenu` primitives
- Mobile menu uses Radix `Sheet` primitives
- No shared state, transforms, or animation systems
- Desktop-only: `hidden md:flex` / Mobile-only: `md:hidden`
- Mobile nav phase system (`use-nav-phase.ts`) doesn't affect desktop

**Why Separate**:
- Mobile: Full-page transform/animation system with card effects
- Desktop: Standard dropdown with fixed positioning
- Different interaction patterns, different UX requirements
- Prevents conflicts and maintains clean boundaries

### Files Modified
- `web/src/components/shared/feature-card.tsx` (new)
- `web/src/components/shared/desktop-mega-menu.tsx` (new)
- `web/src/components/shared/navbar.client.tsx` (updated mega menu rendering)

### Positioning Fix (2025-10-20 - Follow-up)

**Problem #1**: Mega menu dropdown was not aligned with header boundaries
- Dropdown was narrower than header
- Not positioned at correct left/right edges
- Constrained by NavigationMenuItem width instead of header shell

**Attempted Solution #1**: 
- Tried using Radix NavigationMenu with `left-0` + `right-0` positioning
- Failed because dropdown was still constrained by parent NavigationMenuItem

**Final Solution Implemented**:
Created custom `MegaMenuTrigger` component that:
1. Uses refs to measure both the trigger button and `desktop-nav-shell` positions
2. Calculates dynamic offset: `leftOffset = buttonRect.left - navRect.left`
3. Sets dropdown width to exact shell width
4. Applies positioning via inline styles for precision
5. Uses Framer Motion for smooth fade-in animation

**Technical Details**:
- **Hover-based**: Opens/closes on mouse enter/leave
- **Dynamic calculation**: Recalculates on every open to handle scroll/resize
- **Absolute positioning**: Relative to button, but offset to align with shell
- **Full width**: Matches `desktop-nav-shell` width exactly
- **Animation**: 200ms fade + slide with custom easing

**Result**: Mega menu now perfectly aligns with header shell edges (red line boundaries in mockup), spans full width, and works responsively.

### Visual Polish (2025-10-20 - Follow-up #2)

**Adjustments**:
- Increased gap between header and dropdown from 12px (`mt-3`) to 16px (`mt-4`)
- Changed dropdown border radius from `rounded-[16px]` to `rounded-[5px]` to match header
- Updated menu item border radius from `rounded-[12px]` to `rounded-[8px]` for consistency

**Why**: Creates visual differentiation between header and dropdown while maintaining design system consistency. The smaller, matching radius creates a cohesive look.

### Hover Interaction Fix (2025-10-20 - Follow-up #3)

**Problem**: Dropdown was closing when moving mouse from trigger to dropdown content
- Gap between trigger and dropdown broke hover state
- Made it difficult/impossible to interact with dropdown items

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Delayed close with timeout**: 
   - Added 150ms delay before closing when mouse leaves
   - Timeout is cancelled if mouse re-enters before delay expires
   - Gives smooth transition period for mouse movement

2. **Invisible hover bridge**:
   - Added invisible div (`h-4`, 16px height) between trigger and dropdown
   - Covers the gap so hover state is maintained
   - Uses `aria-hidden="true"` for accessibility

**Technical Details**:
- `closeTimeoutRef`: Stores timeout reference for cancellation
- Cleanup effect ensures timeout is cleared on unmount
- Bridge element maintains hover without visual interference

**Result**: Smooth, reliable hover interaction. Users can easily move from trigger to dropdown and interact with menu items without the menu disappearing.

### Major Bug Fixes (2025-10-20 - Follow-up #4)

**Issues Identified**:
1. Dropdown flickering when moving between menu items (e.g., Marketing ‚Üí Web)
2. Menu content changing color when mouse leaves the menu area
3. Unreadable text in Light Alt theme due to poor contrast

**Root Causes**:
1. Each menu item was rendering its own dropdown, causing unmount/remount flickering
2. Hover states persisting or changing incorrectly after mouse exit
3. Using color-mix with low opacity percentages (45-55%) that reduced contrast in light themes

**Solutions Implemented**:

**1. Shared Dropdown Architecture**:
- Created `SharedMegaMenuDropdown` component - single dropdown for all menus
- Triggers (`MegaMenuTrigger`) now simplified - just buttons that update state
- Content switches instantly without unmounting the container
- Uses Framer Motion with `animate` (not conditional rendering) for smooth transitions
- Fixed positioning calculation using `getBoundingClientRect()` on parent shell

**2. Proper Hover State Management**:
- Moved timeout logic to parent component (`NavbarClient`)
- `handleMegaMenuOpen`: Cancels pending close, sets active menu + content
- `handleMegaMenuClose`: 150ms delayed close with content cleanup
- `cancelMegaMenuClose`: Clears timeout when re-entering
- No more hover state conflicts when mouse leaves

**3. Improved Theme Contrast**:
- Added CSS custom property fallbacks: `--text-secondary`, `--text-tertiary`, `--surface-muted`, `--accent-bg`
- Increased opacity percentages: 45% ‚Üí 55%, 55% ‚Üí 65%, 58% ‚Üí 70%
- Better contrast ratios across all themes (Light Alt, Light, Dark)
- Explicit `text-[color:var(--foreground)]` on base container for inheritance
- Simplified hover states to reduce color jank

**Technical Details**:
- SharedMegaMenuDropdown uses `fixed` positioning relative to viewport
- Calculates position from `desktop-nav-shell` measurements
- Content persists 200ms after close for smooth exit animation
- Hover bridge remains to maintain interaction
- Border transitions: `border-transparent` ‚Üí `border-[color:var(--border)]`

**Files Modified**:
- `navbar.client.tsx`: Refactored to shared dropdown architecture
- `desktop-mega-menu.tsx`: Improved color contrast and hover states

**Result**: 
‚úÖ No more flickering between menu items
‚úÖ Stable colors when mouse leaves
‚úÖ Readable in all themes (Light Alt, Light, Dark)
‚úÖ Smooth, professional mega menu experience

### Content Transition Animations (2025-10-20 - Follow-up #5)

**Enhancement Request**: Add smooth animated transitions when switching between menu sections (Marketing ‚Üî Web)

**Problem**: While the shared dropdown architecture fixed flickering, content was still swapping instantly, feeling abrupt and jarring.

**Solution Implemented**:

**AnimatePresence with Cross-fade + Slide**:
- Wrapped content in Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` with `mode="wait"`
- Each menu section gets a unique `key` (label) for proper enter/exit tracking
- **Exit animation**: Fades out + slides right (`opacity: 0, x: 20`)
- **Enter animation**: Fades in + slides from left (`opacity: 0, x: -20` ‚Üí `opacity: 1, x: 0`)
- Duration: 110ms with instant easing `[0.4, 0, 0.2, 1]`

**Technical Details**:
```jsx
<AnimatePresence mode="wait" initial={false}>
  {contentKey && (
    <motion.div
      key={contentKey}
      initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0, x: 20 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.11, ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] }}
    >
      {content}
    </motion.div>
  )}
</AnimatePresence>
```

**Why `mode="wait"`**:
- Ensures old content fully exits before new content enters
- Prevents overlap/jank during transition
- Creates clean "morphing" effect

**Content Cleanup Timing**:
- Reduced to 120ms for instant cleanup
- Matches the ultra-fast 80ms animation duration

**Result**: 
‚úÖ Smooth, polished transitions between menu sections
‚úÖ Content "morphs" rather than "pops"
‚úÖ Directional slide (left‚Üíright for exit, right‚Üíleft for enter) provides spatial context
‚úÖ Professional, intentional feel that matches modern UI standards

### Future Improvements
- [x] Integrate Sanity CMS for dynamic featured case data per menu section ‚úÖ
- [x] Add image assets to featured case cards ‚úÖ
- [ ] Consider adding keyboard navigation enhancements
- [ ] Performance: lazy-load featured case images
- [ ] A/B test mega menu vs. simple dropdown for conversion impact

### Impact
- Modern, professional desktop navigation experience
- Improved information architecture with rich menu items
- Visual consistency with hero section through shared card component
- Scalable: easy to add new menu sections with minimal code
- No breaking changes or conflicts with mobile navigation
- Pixel-perfect alignment with header boundaries

## [2024-12-19] ‚Äì Mobile Menu Stacking Context Fix (Final)
Goal: Fix mobile menu panel/sheet interaction where panel either hides the sheet visually or becomes non-interactive

### Problem Analysis
- Panel (`mobile-nav-panel`) had `z-[40]` but needed to be above overlay (`z-index: 50`) and below shell (`z-index: 60`)
- When panel was above shell: visually hid the rounded sheet edges
- When panel was below shell: overlay intercepted clicks, making panel non-interactive
- Trade-off between visual appearance and functionality

### Solution Implemented (Final Revision)
**Correct Layering Order:**
1. **Shell/Sheet Layer** (`z-index: 60`): The rounded card that shows the site content
2. **Panel Layer** (`z-index: 55`): Menu panel, below shell so card remains visible
3. **Overlay Layer** (`z-index: 50`): Transparent overlay for click-outside dismissal

**Key Changes:**
- Panel `z-index: 55 !important` (below shell to keep card visible)
- Shell `z-index: 60` with `pointer-events: none` when menu open
- Overlay `z-index: 50 !important` with `pointer-events: auto` for dismissal
- Removed `isolation: isolate` from body and site-shell
- Removed conflicting `z-[40]` from navbar component
- Added `!important` to override Radix Sheet defaults

**Visual Design:**
- Panel has solid background `var(--mobile-nav-surface)`
- Shell transforms and shows rounded corners
- Panel slides in from left, shell transforms right
- Clean visual separation without complex wrapping

**CSS Variables Used:**
- `--mobile-nav-width`: Panel width for click area calculation
- `--nav-card-inset`: Sheet inset for visual alignment
- `--nav-card-border-radius`: Matching rounded corners
- `--mobile-nav-surface`: Background color for visual consistency

### Technical Details
- Panel content remains fully interactive (links, CTA, theme/locale toggles)
- Visual backdrop wraps sheet's curved edges without gaps
- Overlay only catches taps outside the panel area
- Maintains existing animation timing and cleanup phases
- Uses minimal CSS variables for future component compatibility

### Files Modified
- `web/src/app/globals.css`: Added layered z-index solution and pseudo-elements
- `web/src/components/shared/navbar.client.tsx`: Made panel background transparent

### Testing Required
- [ ] Test on homepage (`/`) with varied content heights
- [ ] Test on contact page (`/kontakt`) 
- [ ] Verify smooth open/close animations
- [ ] Check for visual gaps or seams on different viewport sizes
- [ ] Confirm panel links remain clickable
- [ ] Verify overlay tap dismissal works

### Impact
- Resolves core stacking context conflict
- Maintains visual design integrity
- Preserves interactive functionality
- Uses existing CSS variable system
- No breaking changes to existing components

## [2024-12-19] ‚Äì Mega Menu Layout & Hero FeatureCard Integration
**Goal**: Redistribute mega menu layout and integrate hero FeatureCard for case showcase

**Layout Redistribution**:
- **Column Widths**: Changed from `[1.8fr, 1fr]` to `[1fr, 1.5fr]` (40% left, 60% right)
- **Left Column**: Added `max-w-[400px]` to constrain HIGHLIGHT FEATURE section
- **Content Positioning**: Pushed left column content closer to the left edge
- **Space Utilization**: Right column now has more room for featured content

**Hero FeatureCard Integration**:
- **Replaced**: Basic grey card with full `HeroFeatureCarousel` component
- **Sanity Integration**: Fetches real case studies using `caseStudiesQuery`
- **Data Mapping**: Converts Sanity case data to `HeroFeatureDisplayItem` format
- **Features**: Same glass-morphic styling, carousel navigation, image handling, LQIP
- **Content**: Shows top 3 case studies with proper titles, excerpts, images, and links

**Technical Implementation**:
```tsx
// Fetch case studies on component mount
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchCases = async () => {
    const cases = await fetchSanity(caseStudiesQuery, {});
    const featuredCasesData = (Array.isArray(cases) ? cases : [])
      .slice(0, 3)
      .map((caseStudy) => ({
        key: caseStudy._id,
        title: caseStudy.title,
        excerpt: caseStudy.excerpt,
        href: `/cases/${caseStudy.slug}`,
        metaLabel: caseStudy.client || "CASE",
        image: caseStudy.media?.image?.image?.asset ? {
          url: caseStudy.media.image.image.asset.url,
          alt: caseStudy.media.image.alt || caseStudy.title,
          lqip: caseStudy.media.image.image.asset.metadata?.lqip,
        } : null,
      }));
    setFeaturedCases(featuredCasesData);
  };
  fetchCases();
}, []);
```

**UI Changes**:
- **Right Column Header**: Added "FEATURED CASES" label
- **Carousel Integration**: Full `HeroFeatureCarousel` with navigation arrows
- **Responsive**: Maintains proper layout on all screen sizes
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches hero section exactly

**Result**:
‚úÖ **Better Space Utilization**: Left column compact, right column spacious
‚úÖ **Dynamic Content**: Real case studies from Sanity CMS
‚úÖ **Rich Interaction**: Full carousel functionality with navigation
‚úÖ **Visual Consistency**: Identical styling to hero section
‚úÖ **Performance**: Efficient data fetching and caching

## [2025-10-31] ‚Äì Smart Grid Position Picker with Context Awareness

**Goal**: Make the grid position picker dynamically show only available cells and mark occupied ones

**Challenges Solved**:
This was a complex feature requiring deep integration with Sanity's document context system to:
1. Read the parent gallery's column/row configuration
2. Access all sibling images to calculate occupied cells
3. Update the UI dynamically based on context

**Implementation**:

1. **Dynamic Grid Size**:
   - Grid now shows only the columns/rows configured in the parent gallery
   - Reads `columns` and `rows` from document context
   - Navigates up the path tree from `position` ‚Üí `images[_key]` ‚Üí parent gallery block
   - Updates title to show actual grid dimensions (e.g., "5 columns √ó 10 rows")

2. **Occupied Cell Detection**:
   - Calculates which cells are occupied by other images in the gallery
   - Iterates through all sibling images in the `images[]` array
   - For each image with a position, marks all its cells as occupied
   - Excludes the current image from occupation calculation

3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - **Gray cells** (`#d1d5db`): Occupied by other images, not clickable
   - **Blue cells** (`#4f46e5`): Currently selected for this image
   - **White cells** (`#f3f4f6`): Available for selection
   - Reduced opacity (0.6) on occupied cells for clarity
   - Added warning message: "‚ö†Ô∏è Gray cells are occupied by other images"

4. **Interaction Improvements**:
   - Occupied cells have `cursor: not-allowed`
   - Clicking occupied cells does nothing (early return)
   - Hover effects disabled on occupied cells
   - Tooltip on hover shows "Cell occupied by another image"

5. **Context Navigation Logic**:
   - Uses Sanity's `path` array to navigate document structure
   - Handles both string segments (field names) and object segments (array keys)
   - Finds current image's `_key` to exclude it from occupancy calculation
   - Traverses to parent gallery block to read configuration

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ **Intuitive**: Only shows relevant grid cells
- ‚úÖ **Prevents Conflicts**: Can't place images on occupied cells
- ‚úÖ **Visual Clarity**: Clear distinction between available/occupied/selected
- ‚úÖ **Smart**: Automatically adapts to gallery configuration

**Files Changed**:
- `src/sanity/components/GridPositionInput.tsx` - Complete rewrite with context awareness

**UX Improvements**:
- No more confusion about which cells are available
- Prevents accidental overlapping placements
- Scales UI to match actual gallery size
- Real-time feedback as other images are positioned

## [2025-10-31] ‚Äì Grid Position Picker: Fixed Occupied Cell Detection + UI Polish

**Issue**: Occupied cells weren't showing up when adding new images to the gallery

**Root Cause**: 
The path navigation logic was too complex and didn't handle all Sanity document structures correctly. The original approach tried to navigate the path array generically, but Sanity's context can vary.

**Solution**:

1. **Simplified Path Detection**:
   - Look directly for `pageBlocks` array in document
   - Search for `bentoGallery` type blocks
   - Check if block contains the current image (via `_key`)
   - Fallback: Check if document itself is a gallery (for direct editing)
   - More robust and handles multiple gallery structures

2. **Added Extensive Debug Logging**:
   - Logs document path and full document structure
   - Shows current image key detection
   - Displays gallery dimensions found
   - Lists all images and their positions
   - Reports occupied cells count
   - Helps diagnose issues in browser console (F12)

3. **UI Improvements (Per User Request)**:
   - **Perfectly Square Cells**: Used `aspectRatio: "1 / 1"` on each cell
   - **Rounded Corners**: Set `borderRadius: "6px"` for softer look
   - **Better Spacing**: Increased gap from 2px to 4px
   - **Maintained Grid Proportions**: Added `aspectRatio` to container
   - Cleaner, more polished appearance

**Key Code Changes**:
`	ypescript
// Simplified gallery finding logic
if (document.pageBlocks && Array.isArray(document.pageBlocks)) {
  for (const block of document.pageBlocks) {
    if (block._type === "bentoGallery" && block.images) {
      const hasCurrentImage = block.images.some((img: any) => img._key === currentKey);
      if (hasCurrentImage || !currentKey) {
        galleryBlock = block;
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}

// Fallback for direct gallery editing
if (!galleryBlock && document._type === "bentoGallery") {
  galleryBlock = document;
}
`

**Debugging**:
When using the grid picker, open browser console (F12) to see:
- üîç Document path structure
- üîë Current image key
- üì¶ Gallery block found
- üìê Gallery dimensions
- üñºÔ∏è Total images count
- üìç Each image's position
- üö´ Total occupied cells

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Occupied cells now display correctly (gray with not-allowed cursor)
- ‚úÖ Perfect square cells with elegant rounded corners
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ More robust document structure handling

**Files Changed**:
- `src/sanity/components/GridPositionInput.tsx` - Simplified path logic, added logging, UI polish

## [2025-10-31] ‚Äì Schema Field Reordering + Enhanced Grid Position Debugging

**Changes Made**:

1. **Reordered Bento Gallery Fields** (per user request):
   - Moved `columns` and `rows` fields ABOVE `images` field
   - Now admins configure grid dimensions first, then add images
   - More logical workflow: set up grid ‚Üí add images ‚Üí position them
   - Field order: sectionId ‚Üí columns ‚Üí rows ‚Üí images

2. **Comprehensive Grid Position Debugging**:
   - Added detailed debug panel visible directly in Sanity Studio UI
   - Shows complete diagnostic information without needing browser console
   - Debug panel displays:
     * Document path structure
     * Document type
     * Current image `_key`
     * All pageBlocks found
     * Gallery block detection
     * Gallery dimensions
     * All images in gallery with their keys
     * Each image's position data
     * Total occupied cells count
     * List of occupied cell coordinates
   
3. **Enhanced Console Logging**:
   - Structured debug messages with emojis for easy reading
   - Step-by-step gallery block detection process
   - Image-by-image position analysis
   - Clear indication when images are skipped (current image)
   - Warning messages when gallery block not found

**Debug Panel Format**:
`
=== GridPositionInput Debug ===
Path: [...]
Document type: caseStudy
Document has pageBlocks: true
üì¶ Checking 3 pageBlocks...
  - Block type: hero, has images: false
  - Block type: bentoGallery, has images: true
    Found bentoGallery with 3 images
    Image keys in gallery: abc123, def456, ghi789
    Contains current image (ghi789): true
‚úÖ Using this gallery block
üìê Gallery dimensions: 5√ó10
üñºÔ∏è Total images in gallery: 3
  Image 1: _key=abc123
    Position: {"columnStart":1,"columnSpan":2,"rowStart":1,"rowSpan":2}
    üìç Occupies: col 1-2, row 1-2
  Image 2: _key=def456
    Position: {"columnStart":3,"columnSpan":3,"rowStart":1,"rowSpan":1}
    üìç Occupies: col 3-5, row 1-1
  Image 3: _key=ghi789
    ‚è≠Ô∏è This is the current image, skipping
üö´ Total occupied cells: 7
   Occupied cells: 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2, 3-1, 4-1, 5-1
`

**Purpose**:
This comprehensive logging will help diagnose why occupied cells aren't appearing. The user can now see exactly:
- Whether the gallery is being found
- Which images exist and their `_key` values
- What position data each image has
- How many cells should be marked as occupied

**Next Steps for User**:
1. Refresh Sanity Studio (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Open a bento gallery with multiple positioned images
3. Try to add/edit an image's position
4. Look at the yellow "üîç Debug Info" panel at the bottom
5. Share the debug output to diagnose the issue

**Files Changed**:
- `src/sanity/types/sections/bentoGallery.ts` - Reordered fields
- `src/sanity/components/GridPositionInput.tsx` - Added debug panel + enhanced logging

---

## [2025-10-31] ‚Äì Grid Lines Toggle + Enhanced Debug Diagnostics

**Changes Made**:

1. **Grid Lines Toggle Added**:
   - Added `showGridLines` boolean field to bentoGallery schema
   - Positioned between `rows` and `images` fields
   - Default value: `true` (grid lines visible by default)
   - Description: "Show red grid lines overlay to visualize rows and columns"

2. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - Updated `BentoGallerySectionData` type to include `showGridLines`
   - Passed `showGridLines` prop through server ‚Üí client components
   - Wrapped grid lines overlay in conditional: `{showGridLines && (...)`}
   - Grid lines now toggle on/off based on Sanity setting

3. **Debug Info Enhancement**:
   - Added early bailout when document/path are undefined
   - Shows what props are available: `Props keys: value, onChange, ...`
   - Identifies if Sanity is passing document context
   - Provides clear error message when context is missing:
     `
     ‚ùå No document or path context available
     This means Sanity isn't passing the parent document context.
     Falling back to defaults (no occupied cell detection possible)
     `

4. **GROQ Query Update**:
   - Added `showGridLines` to bentoGallery fetch in `caseStudyBySlugQuery`

**How Grid Lines Toggle Works**:
- Admin toggles "Show Grid Lines" checkbox in Sanity
- Setting is saved to gallery configuration
- Frontend conditionally renders red grid overlay
- When `false`, no grid lines appear on the live site
- Useful for: 
  * Development: Show grid lines to position images
  * Production: Hide grid lines for clean gallery

**Debug Info Status**:
The debug panel now explicitly checks if `document` and `path` props exist. If they don't, it means:
- Sanity v3 may not pass parent document context to custom object input components
- We may need to use a different approach (e.g., `useFormValue` hook)
- The debug output will now show exactly what props ARE available

**Next Steps for User**:
1. Hard refresh Sanity Studio (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check the debug panel - it should now show either:
   - Full debug info with gallery details, OR
   - Clear message about missing document context + list of available props
3. Share the debug output to diagnose the occupied cells issue

**Files Changed**:
- `src/sanity/types/sections/bentoGallery.ts` - Added showGridLines field
- `src/lib/sanity.queries.ts` - Fetch showGridLines
- `src/components/sections/bento-gallery.tsx` - Pass showGridLines prop
- `src/components/sections/bento-gallery.client.tsx` - Conditional grid lines render
- `src/sanity/components/GridPositionInput.tsx` - Enhanced debug info with prop inspection

## [2025-10-31] ‚Äì FIXED: Occupied Cell Detection using useFormValue Hook

**The Problem**:
User reported occupied cells weren't showing in the grid position picker. Debug output revealed:
`
Has document: false
Has path: true
Props keys: elementProps, level, members, value, readOnly, ...
`

**Root Cause**:
- Sanity v3 doesn't pass `document` prop to custom input components
- Was trying to access `props.document` which is undefined
- Custom inputs in Sanity v3 need to use hooks to access form context

**The Solution**:
Imported and used Sanity's `useFormValue` hook:
`	ypescript
import { useFormValue } from "sanity";

const GridPositionInputComponent: ComponentType<ObjectInputProps> = (props) => {
  const { value, onChange, path } = props;
  
  // Use Sanity's useFormValue hook to get the document context
  const document = useFormValue([]) as any;
  
  // ... rest of component
};
`

**How useFormValue Works**:
- `useFormValue([])` - Empty array returns the entire document
- `useFormValue(['title'])` - Would return just the title field
- `useFormValue(['pageBlocks', 0])` - Would return first pageBlock
- It's Sanity v3's way to access form/document context in custom components

**What This Fixes**:
- ‚úÖ Grid position picker now has access to the full document
- ‚úÖ Can find the parent bentoGallery block
- ‚úÖ Can read all images in the gallery
- ‚úÖ Can detect which cells are occupied by other images
- ‚úÖ Gray occupied cells should now appear correctly

**Updated Debug Output**:
Now shows:
`
=== GridPositionInput Debug ===
Document via useFormValue: true ‚úÖ
Has path: true
Document type: caseStudy
üì¶ Found gallery block
üñºÔ∏è Total images in gallery: 3
üìç Image positions
üö´ Total occupied cells: 8
`

**Next Steps for User**:
1. Hard refresh Sanity Studio (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Open a bento gallery with multiple positioned images
3. Add/edit an image's position
4. **Occupied cells should now appear as gray squares!** üéâ

**Files Changed**:
- `src/sanity/components/GridPositionInput.tsx` - Added useFormValue hook

**Technical Notes**:
- This is a Sanity v3 specific requirement
- In Sanity v2, `document` was passed as a prop
- In Sanity v3, must use hooks: `useFormValue`, `useDocumentPane`, etc.
- The hook re-renders the component when document changes (reactive)
